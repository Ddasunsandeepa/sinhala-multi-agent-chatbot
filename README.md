# 🇱🇰 Sinhala Multi-Agent Conversational Assistant 🤖

A web-based Sinhala NLP chatbot built using a Multi-Agent Architecture with Hybrid Intent Detection (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression).

This system demonstrates modular AI design, Sinhala language processing, and machine learning-based intent classification.

---

##  Project Overview

This project implements a Sinhala conversational assistant using:

- Rule-based NLP preprocessing
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Logistic Regression for intent classification
- Multi-Agent routing architecture
- Flask web interface
- Animated modern UI

The system processes Sinhala Unicode text and routes user queries to specialized conversational agents.

## 🤖 Multi-Agent Design

Each agent has a single responsibility:

- Greeting Agent
- FAQ Agent (Library Info)
- University Info Agent
- Small Talk Agent
- Fallback Agent

This modular design improves scalability and maintainability.
